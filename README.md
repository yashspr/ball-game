# Ball Game

"Ball Game", for lack of a better name, is a simple game built with the C++ language and the OpenGL Graphics library. In this game, there is a ball that keeps bouncing off the left, right and top walls (edges of the screen) and it isn't supposed to touch the bottom wall. There will be a small bar/paddle at the bottom using which you should prevent the ball from touching the bottom edge. You will have 3 lives and your score will be counted.

## Tech Stack

* **C++** - Language used to develop the project
* **OpenGL** - Library used to build the graphics

## Issues/Future Improvement

It is not a major issue. Its a funny this because the ball in the game is not round. The "ball" in the game is actually a square. Design the ball as a circle resulted in inaccurate edge detection. Hence, had to resort to the square shape. This can be a definite future improvement.

**This mini project was developed as part of the Computer Graphics subject in the 6th semester of my CSE Engineering.**
